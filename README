This is one of the projects used at @dpp's Lift course held at Skillsmatter, London, March 2011.

The code is the state of the code at the end of the class, and as such probably isn't going to make a lot of sense but might contain something someone can find useful.

From my notes:
 * this project was a demonstration of Wiring, where Torsten asked about managing bi-directional updates via an example of a currency conversion: enter euros in one field and have the dollar field update, but also go the other way, and have Lift manage it all for us.  
 * main files touched: snippet/Wired.scala and webapp/index.html
 * See: http://stable.simply.liftweb.net/#toc-Chapter-6
 
Run with:

  $ sbt
  > update
  > jetty-run
